<h2>Improvements</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Better OpenWRT support</dt>
	<dd>
		<tt>Enocode.pm</tt> is no longer required. This cuts about
		2MB of required packages.
	</dd>

	<dt>DELAY()</dt>
	<dd>
		Now rsget.pl can postpone some URIs for later. Useful if some
		file is unavailable temporarily.
	</dd>

	<dt>Direct downloaders</dt>
	<dd>
		You can download any file directly from various protocols.
		<ul>
			<li><tt>http://</tt> - file must not be text or small image</li>
			<li><tt>ftp://</tt> - may be buggy</li>
			<li><tt>rtmp://</tt> - may be buggy, requires recent curl
				with rtmp support enabled</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>postdownload callback</dt>
	<dd>
		Executes your external application after finishing download.
		You can use it to extract files, copy them to another harddrive,
		different computer or do anything else you see fit.
	</dd>

	<dt>Simple http interface for external captcha solvers</dt>
	<dd>
		You can easily write some popup application to warn you about
		new captchas to solve. You can check
		<tt>http://localhost:7666/captcha</tt> for a list of captchas
		to solve. It returns plain text file with captcha md5 and time
		left to solve it in seconds. Download the image from
		<tt>http://localhost:7666/captcha?md5=${MD5}</tt> and when
		you've got the solution report it as:
		<tt>http://localhost:7666/captcha?md5=${MD5}&amp;solve=${CAPTCHA}</tt>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Makefile changes</dt>
	<dd>
		Makefile now installs rsget.pl to /usr/local by default.
		Set <tt>PREFIX=/usr</tt> if you are a packager.
		Shell parts are POSIX compatible now. Fixes problems with dash.
	</dd>

	<dt>MefiaFire dropped</dt>
	<dd>
		This service changes too often to keep up with it.
	</dd>

	<dt>List locking</dt>
	<dd>
		Prevents from running multiple instances of rsget.pl on the
		same uri list file.
	</dd>

	<dt>Partial XDG support</dt>
	<dd>
		Now you can put your config file in <tt>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rsget.pl</tt>
		or <tt>$HOME/.config/rsget.pl</tt>. SVN autoupdate will be
		downloaded there if it exists.<br />
		You can set all the other paths to xdg-compatible ones in your
		config file. If your environment is properly set your config
		file could look like this (<tt>${RSGET_DIR}</tt> is set by
		rsget.pl to the directory where config file is found):
		<pre># uri list at ~/.config/rsget.pl/get.list
list_file = ${RSGET_DIR}/get.list

# save cookies in ~/.config/rsget.pl/tmp (dir must exist)
tmpdir = ${RSGET_DIR}/tmp

# save partial files to ~/.local/share/rsget.pl
workdir = ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/rsget.pl

# move finished downloads to ~/Desktop/downloads
donedir = ${XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR}</pre>
	</dd>

	<dt>Log output to file</dt>
	<dd>
		Set <tt>logfile=SOME_PATH</tt> to enable logging.
	</dd>
</dl>
