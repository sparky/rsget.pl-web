title:	2010-04-07: new core
desc:	<strong>New rsget.pl ! Help wanted.</strong>

body:	
<p>I have started work on new rsget.pl core code, which should address some
of problems of the actual one. It will also add features you may have
wanted (premium accounts, multiuser support). Read more at:<br />

<a href="/about/new-core/">http://rsget.pl/about/new-core/</a></p>

<p>And spread the good word !</p>

<p>However, I must ask for your help. This rewrite is going to be a huge
task and I don't want to have to do it ever again. Please, write an email to
&lt;core&at;rsget.pl&gt; with any suggestions you have for the new core and feel free
to help in any other way you see fit. I can't promise all your
expectations will be met right away, but I will make sure to design the
core in such way that will allow adding those features without much
complication.</p>

<p>Thank you, I really appreciate your response !</p>
