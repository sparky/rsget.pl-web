<h2>Components</h2>
<p>
	When reporting bugs you must be aware that rsget.pl is divided in
	three major components.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>[core]</dt>
	<dd>
		It is the main downloader code. Includes everything but the plugins.
		In terms of source code files it is the <tt>rsget.pl</tt> executable,
		everything under <tt>RSGet</tt> directory and files from <tt>data</tt>
		not related to plugins.
	</dd>

	<dt>[plugins]</dt>
	<dd>
		Downloader plugins. That is, everything from <tt>Get</tt>, <tt>Video</tt>,
		<tt>Audio</tt>, <tt>Image</tt>, <tt>Link</tt> and <tt>Direct</tt>
		directories. It also includes files from <tt>data</tt> related to plugins.
	</dd>

	<dt>[web]</dt>
	<dd>
		This web page. It includes text from pages, web design
		(css, javascript and data files). It also includes
		the <a href="/tools/">tools</a> you can find here.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Known bugs</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>[web]</dt>
	<dd>
		<dl>
			<dt>Internet Explorer cannot display this page</dt>
			<dd>That's a bug in IE, it does not support XHTML.
				There is no good reason to remake half the page just to
				support that "web browser".</dd>

			<dt>www.rsget.pl does not work</dt>
			<dd>It isn't a bug, it's a feature.</dd>
		</dl>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Where bugs should be reported</h2>
<h4>bugs.rsget.pl</h4>
<p>
	Thanks to <a href="http://github.com/pawelz">pawelz</a> we have a
	<a href="http://bugs.rsget.pl/browse/RSGETPL">JIRA bug tracker</a>.
	<strong>This is the best way to report problems</strong>,
	especially plugin problems. New issues are not publicly visible,
	only the reporter and rsget.pl developers can see them. Afterwards
	developers may decide to make the bug visible to everyone.
</p>
<p>
	Please be as specific as possible. Use <strong>[core]</strong>,
	<strong>[plugins]</strong> or <strong>[web]</strong> as the first
	word of the <em>summary</em> and select appropriate <em>component</em>.
	Put links and source snippets in <tt>{code}</tt> markers.
</p>
<pre>Some short description of the bug.

{code}
http://link1/
http://link2/
http://link3/
{code}
</pre>


<h4>issues @ github.com</h4>
<p>
	You can report <strong>[core]</strong> problems in the
	<a href="http://github.com/sparky/rsget.pl/issues">rsget.pl/issues</a>
	section of the svn mirror.
	<em>Please do not post <strong>[plugins]</strong> problems there</em>
	unless you are the legal owner of the links you include.
</p>
<p>
	Problems with <strong>[web]</strong> can be reported in the
	<a href="http://github.com/sparky/rsget.pl-web/issues">rsget.pl-web/issues</a>
	section of the web page source.
</p>

<h4>by email</h4>
<p>
	Alternatively you can send the bug reports via email. Note that this is
	not the best solution because some of those reports may get lost,
	be forgotten or stay unanswered. Also they can't be seen by other rsget.pl
	developers.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>rsget.pl <strong>[core]</strong> &lt;<tt>bugs&at;rsget.pl</tt>&gt;</li>
	<li>rsget.pl <strong>[plugins]</strong> &lt;<tt>plugins&at;rsget.pl</tt>&gt;</li>
	<li>rsget.pl <strong>[web]</strong> &lt;<tt>web&at;rsget.pl</tt>&gt;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting bugs hard to reproduce</h2>
<p>
	Some bugs cannot be easily reproduced (e.g. a page may behave
	differently in some geographical zones). Because of this we may ask you
	to post the whole download dump for us to analyze the data.
	To achieve best results follow those steps:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disable all but one failing link.</li>
	<li>Run <strong>rsget.pl</strong> with <tt>--logfile=download.log
			--debug=2</tt> arguments.</li>
	<li>Stop <strong>rsget.pl</strong> as soon as the problem appears.</li>
	<li>Grab <tt>download.log</tt> and all the <tt>dump</tt> files that were
		generated and put them in <tt>.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>.zip</tt> file.</li>
	<li>Attach that archive to the bug report and paste the important lines
		from <tt>download.log</tt></li>
</ul>
