title:	http interface
desc:	How to make best use of the http interface.

body:
<p>HTTP interface is enabled setting http-port to 7666 (used in all examples)
	or any other port you have available. You can do it either by specifying
	<tt>--http-port=7666</tt> on the command line or setting <tt>http_port = 7666</tt>
	in config file. This will enable built-in http server and said interface.
	After starting rsget.pl you will be able to access it entering
	&lt;<tt>http://host_where_you_run_rsget.pl:7666/</tt>&gt; address.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that this built-in server is very weak. It doesn't have a decent
	authentication. It is extremely vulnerable to most DDoS attacks.
	<em>You <strong>MUST</strong> protect it from the "internets".</em>
	On Linux you can use iptables to disable connections from outside your local
	network (assuming your network is 192.168.1.0):</p>

<pre>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp ! -s 192.168.1.0/24 --dport 7666 -j DROP</pre>


<h3>proxy</h3>

<p>If you really want to use http interface from sources you don't trust
	I suggest using apache server as proxy. The following config provides
	much better authentication and some degree of protection.</p>

<pre class="vim"><span class="Comment"># Patch http interface through apache web server.</span>

<span class="Identifier">ProxyPass</span> /rsget.pl/ http://localhost:7666/ retry=2
<span class="Identifier">ProxyPass</span> /rsget.pl/done !

<span class="Statement">&lt;Location</span><span class="Constant"> /rsget.pl</span><span class="Statement">&gt;</span>
	<span class="Identifier">AuthType</span> <span class="Constant">basic</span>
	<span class="Identifier">AuthName</span> <span class="Constant">&quot;rsget.pl downloader&quot;</span>
	<span class="Identifier">AuthBasicProvider</span> file
	<span class="Identifier">AuthUserFile</span> /srv/http/root/rsget.pl/.htpasswd
	<span class="Identifier">Require</span> <span class="Constant">valid-user</span>
	<span class="Identifier">Options</span> <span class="Constant">+FollowSymLinks</span>
<span class="Statement">&lt;/Location&gt;</span></pre>

<p>Assuming you are running rsget.pl on host called <em>my_host</em> you should
be able to access it as &lt;<tt>https://my_host/rsget.pl</tt>&gt;</p>


<h3>download finished files</h3>

<p>Built-in http server does not allow to retrieve finished downloads.
	You must use some real file server for it.
	In the example above you can point <tt>done</tt>
	symbolic link to your download directory and run your rsget.pl with
	http_outdir set as: <tt>--http-outdir=https://my_host/rsget.pl/done/</tt>.</p>

<p><strong>http_outdir</strong> option does not require "proxy" integration. It just makes http
	interface aware that downloaded files can be accessed through external URI.
	You can even use ftp if you wish, in this case config line would be:</p>
<pre>http_outdir = ftp://user@my_host//full/path/to/outdir/</pre>
