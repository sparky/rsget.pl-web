# Copy it to $HOME/.rsget.pl/config and make necessary adjustments.

# backups may be disabled or enabled for 3 different cases:
#  done - make backup of file in donedir
#  continue - make backup of file in workdir if continuing partial download
#  scratch - make backup of file in workdir if downloading it from scratch
#  no - backups are never made
# make backups always:
backup = done,continue,scratch
# make backups of completed downloads only:
#backup = done
# never make backups:
#backup = no

# for file FILE_NAME.EXT by default backups will be named as:
# FILE_NAME-{N}.EXT where {N} is 1, 2, 3...
# to name backups as FILE_NAME.EXT~{N} use:
backup_suf = ~

# Start http server on port 7666 (won't be started by default or if port is 0).
# Make sure the port is blocked in the firewall (only allow IPs you trust),
# because rsget.pl has very weak authentification.
http_port = 7666

# require authentication for http:
#  user: root
#  password: qwerty
http_pass = qwerty

# Some services have no parallel-downloads limitation, set max slots
# for such services. If you've got fast connection and only one
# ip address / interface, increase this number to a large value.
# Number of maximum connections is the number of max_slots multiplied
# by number of ip addresses / interfaces.
max_slots = 8

# number of links to check at once in the same service
max_slots_check = 8

# if you are blessed with multiple interfaces:
#interfaces = eth0, tun0, tun1
# same thing for multiple IP addresses:
#interfaces = 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2, 1.1.1.3

# if your vim stores swap files in different directory and you want list
# file locking:
#list_lock = ${HOME}/.vim/.$(file).swp
# list will be manipulated by some external app which creates .lock file
# in the same directory as list file:
#list_lock = $(dir)/.lock

# store unfinished files in "partial" directory
workdir = partial

# move finished downloads to "done"
outdir = done

# update automatically from SVN (possibly dangerous, but very convenient):
#use_svn = update

# save erroneous pages (only useful for getter debugging):
#debug = 1

# be verbose (useful for debugging):
#verbose = 2

# save captcha images (useful for debugging) in ~/.rsget.pl/captcha directory:
#captcha_save_results = ${RSGET_DIR}/captcha
