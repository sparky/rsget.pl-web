<h3>broken plugins</h3>
<p>
	There isn't any "easy" way to report plugin problems (yet),
	so the best way to accomplish it right now is to send an email
	at &lt;<tt>plugins&at;&domain;</tt>&gt;. Remember to put
	plugins name in the subject and some failing links in mails body,
	also some short explanation of the problem would be nice.
</p>
<h3>new plugins</h3>
<p>
	There are many getters yet to be implemented. If you would really like
	some service supported there are multiple ways to attain it.
</p>
<p>
	You can drop your request at &lt;<tt>plugins&at;&domain;</tt>&gt;.
	When I find some free time and willingness I may prepare that one.
	Just don't expect me to write captcha solver for some complicated
	ones.
</p>
<p>
	If you <a href="/donate/">drop a dime</a> along with the request,
	you may be quite certain the plugin will be prepared in one to three
	days.
</p>
<p>
	But! The most effective way is to write and test that plugin yourself.
	This may be quite difficult though. Plugins are written in perl, but
	it is heavily preprocessed before running, and those mechanisms aren't
	described anywhere.
</p>
<h3>notes</h3>
<p>
	For now only http-only plugins are supported.
	<a href="/news/2010-04-07/">New core</a> may support some
	other ways to retrieve data, like video streaming protocols.
</p>
<p>
	There is no support for premium services right now. This will be fixed
	in the <a href="/news/2010-04-07/">new core</a>.
